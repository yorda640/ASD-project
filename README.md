To run this project,

1. Clone the project
2. run npm install from the root folder
3. run npm install from the client folder
4. run npm install from the server folder
5. make sure you have mongo DB installed on your computer

In case it does not work with the database, check the config file in the server/src/config/env.ts and make sure it has the uri to connect to mongoDB and also the Port 3010, this is the one the front end listens to for fetching data.
